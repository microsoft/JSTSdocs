# Open Folder projects in JavaScript and TypeScript

Visual Studio 2017 introduces the ability to [develop code without projects or solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/develop-code-in-visual-studio-without-projects-or-solutions),
enabling you to open a folder of code and immediately start working with rich editor support such as IntelliSense, search, refactoring, debugging, and more.
In addition, the Node Tools workload adds support for building TypeScript files, managing npm packages, and running npm scripts.

To get started, select _Open Folder_ from the Start Page, or select _File | Open | Folder_ from the main menu.
The Solution Explorer will immediately display all the files in the folder, and you can open any to begin editing.
In the background, Visual Studio will index the files to enable the npm, build, and debug functionality.

## npm Integration

If the folder you opened contains a `package.json` file, right-clicking that file will show a npm specific context menu item.

In the menu you can manage the packages installed by npm in the same way you
[manage npm packages](../nodejs/npm.md) when using a project file.

In addition the menu also allows you to run scripts defined in the scripts element in `package.json`.
These scripts will use the version of Node.js available on the `PATH`, and run in a new window.
This is a great way to execute build or run scripts.

## Build and Debug

### package.json
If the `package.json` in the folder specifies a `main` element, `Debug` will be available in the right click context menu.
Clicking this will start `node.exe` with the specified script as its argument.

### JavaScript files
JavaScript files can be debugged by right-clicking them, and selecting `Debug` from the menu. This will start `node.exe` with that script as its argument.

### TypeScript files and tsconfig.json
If there is no `tsconfig.json` present in the folder, right-clicking a TypeScript file will you give you the option to build and debug that file using `tsc.exe` with default options. (You need to build the file before you can debug.)

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript`

If there is a `tsconfig.json` file present in the folder, right-clicking a TypeScript file will give you the option to debug that TypeScript file, only if there is no `outFile` specified.
If an `outFile` is specified, you can debug that file by right-clicking on the `tsconfig.json` file.
The `tsconfig.json` file will also give you a build option to allow you specify compiler options.
